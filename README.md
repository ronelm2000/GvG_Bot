# About
This is a bot for Discord that simulates a game of Gaia vs Guardian, based on the anime / Visual Novel / mobage Rewrite. It uses various functionalities and utilizes many features from Discord to make the game playable. This is meant to be a long game, lasting at least 15 days (12 hours Action Phase and 12 hours Idle / Strategy Phase), however, it can be adjusted to be a short game.
## Game Requirements
16 Players, 4 for each of the main factions of this game. 
The last faction, the Civilians, can be simply chosen from a random group of people, if there are too few people.
## Factions
### Guardian
They're the secret organization tasked with protecting humanity. They're a handful of outgoing people with superpowers (called Hunter skills), and they have and can kill anyone in their way, but their enemies are mostly Gaia, because of Gaia's aims.
### Gaia
They're the secret organizaiton whose forefront (facade) is Martel Group. Directly headed by its Saint, Kashima Sakura, they're Summoners who use their own Life Force (Aurora) to create familiars. They're the enemies of Guardian because thier belief is that the Key has been Summoned to judge the world for its sins and iniate Salvation, which Guardian wants to prevent at all costs.
### Occult Club
Kotarou Tennouji, the series' Main Character, and Kotori Kanbe, the enigmatic Druid. These two people are neither from Gaia or Guardian. However, as their fellow Occult Club members, Akane Senri, Chihaya Ohtori (his Butler, Sakuya Ohtori is totally irrelevant), happen to be in Gaia, while Lucia Konohana, and Shizuru Nakatsu, belong to Guardian, the now former duo is now in a pinch, especially with them being with the Key, the sole judge of the world. Who shall they side with? Will all the members of the Occult Club return for at least one last encore?
### Key
Then there's the Key, hidden amongst the public, the familiar created by the Earth to judge the world. How will the world be judged? Will the world be saved? "Fond memories," she said. Just what are these fond memories?
